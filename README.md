# Iris-Dataset
Understand and implement the **K-Nearest Neighbors** algorithm for classification problems and visualize how the model performs on real-world data.

This project implements **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classification using the well-known **Iris dataset**. It covers the full ML pipeline: from data preprocessing and normalization to model evaluation and decision boundary visualization.

## Tools & Libraries ##

- Python 3
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Features ##
Load and preprocess the Iris dataset

Normalize features using StandardScaler

Train KNN classifiers with varying K values

Evaluate model using accuracy and confusion matrix

Visualize decision boundaries in 2D feature space

## Output Example ##
Accuracy Scores for different K values

Confusion Matrix

Decision Boundary for 2 selected features
